# Résumé Goldberg Machine

## Description

This project mimics a [Rube Goldberg machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) using code and build
systems. Its intention is to build various modules and combine the generated outputs into my comprehensive résumé in
printable Markdown format. Each module is written using a different language/framework in order to illustrate my skills
related to the specific experience described (when applicable).
